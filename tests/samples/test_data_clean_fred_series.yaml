      notes: "Averages of daily figures.  \r\n\r\nFor additional historical federal\
        \ funds rate data, please see  Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951).\r\
        \n\r\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions\
        \ trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other\
        \ overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve\
        \ account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler\
        \ terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity,\
        \ will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The\
        \ rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined\
        \ between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types\
        \ of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective\
        \ federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced\
        \ by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal\
        \ funds rate target.(2)\r\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets\
        \ eight times a year to determine the federal funds target rate. As previously\
        \ stated, this rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open\
        \ market operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government\
        \ debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by\
        \ selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal funds rate because\
        \ banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks. Similarly, the Federal\
        \ Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government bonds, decreasing the\
        \ federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity for trade. Whether\
        \ the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends on the state of the\
        \ economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation\
        \ pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve,\
        \ the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper economic\
        \ activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower federal funds\
        \ rate target to spur greater economic activity. Therefore, the FOMC must\
        \ observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of\
        \ monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the\
        \ dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions,\
        \ the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices\
        \ and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments,\
        \ and foreign exchange markets.\r\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest\
        \ rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such\
        \ as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher\
        \ credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences\
        \ longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of\
        \ which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\r\nReferences\r\
